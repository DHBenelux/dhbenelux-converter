  abstract = {This paper offers a conceptual framework for establishing a science of transdisciplinary action research. Lewin's (1951) concept of action research highlights the scientific and societal value of translating psychological research into community problem-solving strategies. Implicit in Lewin's formulation is the importance of achieving effective collaboration among behavioral researchers, community members and policy makers. The present analysis builds on Lewin's analysis by outlining programmatic directions for the scientific study of transdisciplinary research and community action. Three types of collaboration, and the contextual circumstances that facilitate or hinder them, are examined: (1) collaboration among scholars representing different disciplines; (2) collaboration among researchers from multiple fields and community practitioners representing diverse professional and lay perspectives; and (3) collaboration among community organizations across local, state, national, and international levels. In the present analysis, transdisciplinary action research is viewed as a topic of scientific study in its own right to achieve a more complete understanding of prior collaborations and to identify strategies for refining and sustaining future collaborations (and their intended outcomes) among researchers, community members and organizations.},

  abstract = {Although there has been an increased uptake of technology-based outputs and methods in humanities research, substantial barriers remain to the full realization of potential benefits in this area. Some of these barriers resonate with the most basic challenges defined by the field of Human\textendash{}Computer Interaction, including the move from computational to faciliatory computing, non-user-centred industrial design of research tools, the application of inappropriate experience models by users, and a cultural mismatch between researchers and technicians. This article develops a model of digital development in the humanities as a `value chain', along which critical gaps appear when the only actors in the chain are the researcher and the technical support staff. Having identified these gaps, the article then goes on to suggest ways in which a dedicated Digital Humanities Intermediary (DHI) is able to provide much needed skills and support of a non-specifically technical nature at critical moments in the projects' development. This kind of intermediary can be instrumental in increasing technology use among humanities research staff, providing a wide range of technical knowledge and other support functions to the relevant faculties in a form that fits well with their own language and preferred ways of working. The success of the position is dependant on solid networks and the enlightened support of the University, however, as it is still very much at the stage of reacting and capitalizing on opportunities as they are encountered, rather than simply slotting in to a stable, static, proven structure.},

This work typically involves the need to coordinate efforts between academics, undergraduate and graduate students, research assistants, computer programmers, librarians, and other individuals as well as the need to manage financial and other resources. Despite this use of collaboration, there has been little formal research on team development within this community. This article reports on a research project exploring the nature of Digital Humanities research teams. Drawing upon interviews with members of the community, a series of exemplary patterns and models of research collaboration are identified and outlined. Important themes include a definition of team which focuses on common tasks and outcomes as well as a need for responsibility and accountability to the team as a whole; elements of a successful team which include clear task definition and productive working relationships over the life of the project and beyond, a need for balance between digital and face-to-face communication and collaboration tools, and potential for more deliberate training in collaboration and team work. The article concludes with recommendations for the individual team members, project leaders, and teams.},

  abstract = {Infrastructures shape and are shaped by modernity -- they are necessary for organizations or systems to work. They can be defined negatively: systems without which contemporary society couldnt' function. They are invisible, at least in the developed world, and until they break down. They are never pure "hardware," but instead sociotechnical systems. Because they are both vital and often invisible, sociotechnical sytems "become" infrastructures. Infrastructural status is acquired. Macro scale studies, like Hughes and LTS group, are functional (over form) and show infrastructure development in historical time. Systems are changing answers to changing problems. Micro scale studies, like Bijker/Law and Social Construction of Tech group, show power of actors to reconfigure infrastructures. They bridge macro, meso, and micro scales of time and space and offer a way to comprehend multiscalar relations. Suggests "mutual orientation" concept by which micro-scale actors interact with meso-scale institutions. They reflect and reinscribe difference and inequality. Invisible working systems in the first world but often don't work elsewhere. They have constraining and enabling effects on social and and individual life. They allow for the (appearance, at least) of systemic control of nature, and thus, format a particular kind and experience of nature. Perhaps most significantly, nature is the ultimate infrastructure (on which all human-built infrastructures ultimately depend) (196). They exist on historical time (why they seem invisible in present oriented human time), but not geophysical time. Suggests a methodolgical approach called "mutual orientation" (213).},

Technological advances have made such cross-boundary projects possible, yet they can carry high coordination costs. This study investigated scientific collaboration across disciplinary and university boundaries to understand the need for coordination in these collaborations and how different levels of coordination predicted success. We conducted a study of 62 scientific collaborations supported by a program of the US National Science Foundation in 1998 and 1999. Projects with principal investigators (PIs) in more disciplines reported as many positive outcomes as did projects involving fewer disciplines. By contrast, multi-university, rather than multidisciplinary, projects were problematic. Projects with PIs from more universities were significantly less well coordinated and reported fewer positive outcomes than projects with PIs from fewer universities. Coordination mechanisms that brought distant researchers together physically slightly reduced the negative impact of collaborations involving multiple universities. We discuss implications for theory, practice, and policy.},

Greater coordination problems are associated with size, distance, interdependence, and scientific competition. Problems of culture and security are associated with size, distance, scientific competition, and commercialization. Email use is associated with reporting fewer coordination problems, but not fewer problems of culture and security, while neither phone use nor face-to-face meetings significantly reduces problems.

The present meta-analysis addresses this inconsistency by examining the moderating influence of communication characteristics, as well as other salient team and task characteristics, on the relationship between team communication and performance. The findings revealed several fundamental insights. First, communication quality had a significantly stronger relationship with team performance than communication frequency. Second, further distinguishing between different communication types, classifying communication into the eight most commonly measured communication forms (e.g., knowledge sharing, information elaboration), has further value; information elaboration has the strongest relationship with performance while self-report frequency and objective frequency have the weakest relationships. Third, familiar and face-to-face teams exhibited a stronger relationship between communication and performance. These results indicate the necessity of distinguishing between different communication types in both practical and theoretical applications of team science.},

While there are many similarities in approaches between DL and DH project teams, some interesting differences exist and may influence the effectiveness of a digital project team with membership that draws from these two communities.

  abstract = {Although there have been many previous studies of research collaboration, comparatively little attention has been given to the concept of `collaboration' or to the adequacy of attempting to measure it through co-authorship. In this paper, we distinguish between collaboration at different levels and show that inter-institutional and international collaboration need not necessarily involve inter-individual collaboration. We also show that co-authorship is no more than a partial indicator of collaboration. Lastly, we argue for a more symmetrical approach in comparing the costs of collaboration with the undoubted benefits when considering policies towards research collaboration.},

  abstract = {This study uses a campus scholarly networking and expertise system to examine trends in coauthorship in order to measure the prevalence of deep collaboration and readiness for team research. Bibliometric analysis of publishing patterns in four departments in the humanities shows significant differences in the rate of coauthorship by type of publication, by department, and by career phase. The data also show that coauthored research has become more common over time. There is notable variation in collaborative practices between departments. This finding suggests that a more granular approach may be needed to incorporate humanities perspectives in team research. \textcopyright{} 2017 by Johns Hopkins University Press.},

The Third Edition is now even more accessible to the introductory student at the very beginning of their statistical journey. The textbook now uniquely walks students from very basic to advanced level concepts, all the while grounding knowledge though the use of SPSS. Accompanied by an improved Companion Web site at www.sagepub.co.uk/field3e including animated SPSS walk-throughs of tests discussed in the textbook; assessment materials and datasets pertinent to lecturers/instructors in Business \& Management and Health Sciences; and a suite of other materials for lecturers/instructors and students as per the 2nd Edition. The original CD-Rom materials are now found on this Web site as well.},

  title = {Creating {{Shared Understanding}} in {{Research Across Distance}}: {{Distance Collaboration}} across {{Cultures}} in {{R}}\&{{D}}},
  abstract = {Planning and managing globally distributed teams presents exceptional challenges in most circumstances. In innovative work, such as research and development (R\&D), where questions are often emergent and processes cannot always be clearly defined in advance, these challenges are exacerbated. A difficult balance between in-person and technology-mediated communications must be achieved when R\&D teams are spread over multiple locations. On the one hand, the complexity of research projects requires resources, skills and knowledge that are not found within any single location. On the other hand, research and, more generally, innovation require cooperation that has traditionally been facilitated by participants meeting in person around a table. In particular, it is not clear to what extent the discovery and interpretation of new research problems requires the copresence of researchers. As projects become more complex and are distributed over greater distances, in-person meetings are often not feasible or practical. They are increasingly being replaced by the use of communication technologies. While these technologies allow more frequent communications between distant collaborators, they also reduce the ``bandwidth'' of that communication. Facial expressions, body language, tone of voice, etc. may be lost. However, successful collaboration, especially for innovative research, relies to a large extent on intense interaction to create a shared language, a common understanding of problems, and the trust required for members of a group to suggest original and untried solutions. These crucial factors are not readily transferred across electronic networks. How, then, do corporations and researchers deal with the challenge of collaborating across geographic distance and organizational boundaries using technology-mediated communication? How are differences in education and national culture bridged? Through analysis of a series of qualitative interviews in international R\&D centers in Bangalore, India, these questions are addressed in this chapter.},
