Digital Tool Criticism

Organisers: Marijn Koolen (KNAW Humanities Cluster, marijn.koolen@huygens.knaw.nl), Jasmijn van Gorp (Utrecht University, J.vanGorp@uu.nl), Jacco van Ossenbruggen (CWI, VU University Amsterdam, j.r.van.Ossenbruggen@vu.nl)

The aim of this workshop is to bring together people with an interest in Digital Humanities research to collaboratively establish guidelines for tool criticism in DH research and is a follow-up the the DH Benelux 2017 workshop on Tool Criticism. With tool criticism we mean the reflection on the role of digital tools in research methodology and the evaluation of the suitability of a given digital tool for a specific research goal. Our aim is to understand the impact of any limitation of the tool on the specific goal, not to improve its performance. While source criticism is common practice in many academic fields, the awareness for biases inherent in digital tools and their influence on research tasks needs to be increased. This requires researchers, data custodians and tool providers to understand issues from different perspectives. Researchers need to be trained to anticipate and recognize tool bias and its impact on their research results.
Data custodians and tool providers, on the other hand, have to make information about the potential biases of the underlying processes more transparent. This includes processes such as collection policies, digitization procedures, OCR, data enrichment and linking, quality assessment, error correction and search technologies.


The workshop will be highly interactive, combining hands-on experimentation with discussion and reflection on the impact of data and tool limitations on the research outcomes. Participants work on their assignments in groups, as previous experiences have shown that collaborative experimentation and documentation encourages them to reflect on this process. To ensure that the outcome of the assignments can be compared across groups, we limit the range of tools and datasets that are used, but that are relevant to a broad range of humanities disciplines,allowing criticism from different perspectives and methodologies. We will use a model for digital tool criticism that we developed in response the 2017 workshop, that will guide participants in structuring the process of exploratory research, documentation and reflection.


At the end of the workshop, groups will present and compare their findings, and we intend to collaboratively draft a set of guidelines and a checklist for DH tool criticism that is relevant to be both creators and users of digital research tools. Participants are invited to co-author a paper based on the workshop that will be submitted to an international digital humanities journal.

 

Introduction to Born-Digital Heritage: from harvesting to analysing Web Archives

Organisers: Sally Chambers, Digital Humanities Research Coordinator, GhentCDH, Ghent University (Sally.Chambers@UGent.be) and Valérie Schafer (Professor of Contemporary European History, C2DH, University of Luxembourg, valerie.schafer@uni.lu)

“For historians, and researchers in many other humanities disciplines, web archives remain largely an unknown, and certainly underused, primary source. Even within digital humanities, web archives as a focus for study have remained on the fringe. “  Jane Winters (2017)

The history of the World Wide Web already spans more than a quarter of a century. The Internet Archive, as well as several National Libraries and Archives, have already been archiving the web for over 20 years. Yet, the use of the archived web as an object of research remains at the fringes of (digital) humanities research.  Although most researchers in the humanities still need to begin to explore the potential of these archives, some projects have already investigated their potential. The Big UK Domain Data for the Arts and Humanities (BUDDAH) project or the research being undertaken by member of the RESAW network (Research Infrastructure for the Study of Archived Web Materials), being particular examples.

The aim of this one day workshop at DH Benelux is to introduce digital humanities researchers to the possibilities of using the archived web as a research resource. The workshop will be start out with an introduction to web archiving, in which participants will be introduced to the web as a historical resource. This section of the programme will include presentations of some existing web-archives, as well as an introduction to the technicalities of web-archiving.

In the second part of the workshop, participants will have the opportunity to explore some of the existing research using the archived web. In this session, researchers, from a range of disciplines across the humanities and social sciences will present the research that they undertake using archived web resources. The third session of the day will enable participants to delve deeper into the data-level of of archived web resources. This part of the workshop will include an introduction to the Web ARCHived (WARC) file format as well as an introduction to the Archives unleashed toolkit. Furthermore, a number of tools to analyse archived web materials will be presented.

The final session of the workshop will be dedicated to a hands-on web archiving challenge, in which participants will have the opportunity to work directly with archived web content. In small groups, participants will be confronted with a Benelux-themed challenge related to “web archives to study Benelux”.

Network analysis and new approaches to music history

Organisers: Marnix van Berchum (Utrecht University, m.vanberchum@uu.nl) Stephen Rose (Royal Holloway, University of London, stephen.rose@rhul.ac.uk) Thomas Delpeut (Radboud University, t.delpeut@let.ru.nl)

This workshop explores the opportunities and challenges arising when network analysis is applied to the study of music history. It is aimed at both digital humanities specialists who wish to gain new perspectives from the domain of music, and musicologists who wish to learn more about the concepts and techniques of network analysis. By the end of the workshop, attendees should have gained a clearer understanding of: how network analysis can illuminate musicology (particularly the branches of musicology using large quantities of data), how network conceptualisations can be translated into data-driven methodologies, and how other disciplines might benefit from approaches developed specifically for studying music. Music has a particularly multi-layered, multimodal nature, involving compositions, performances, audiences, critical discourses, social contexts, etc. The workshop will discuss how these elements can be modelled and analysed as networks, and how music’s multimodal nature can offer new perspectives for network analysis in other disciplines (for instance, how literary studies can address the performative networks surrounding texts and authors).

Following initial introductions, the workshop will begin with a conceptual discussion, tackling such questions as:

    How can the approaches of Social Network Analysis and Actor-Network Theory be reconciled with a data-driven approach to the study of music history?
    How can the analysis of musical networks promote a more relational approach to music history?
    What domain-specific challenges arise when analysing networks in music?

The second part of the workshop introduces specific music datasets that are suitable for modelling as networks, including:

    Music catalogue data from the British Library, covering published music from 1500 to the present day;
    Data from Dutch 19th-century concert life (programmes, audiences, finances, texts);
    Data for early music manuscripts and prints 1400-1600.

Participants are encouraged to bring examples of other musicological datasets suitable for network analysis; please contact m.vanberchum@uu.nl if you would like to discuss a dataset or submit a sample of it.

The above-mentioned datasets and those submitted by participants will be discussed in a plenary setting, showing the relevance of these approaches to a broader range of fields, including other humanities disciplines, music information retrieval, and the library/heritage sector.

 

LIWC in the Digital Humanities

Organisers: Peter Boot, peter.boot@huygens.knaw.nl, Hennie Brugman, hennie.brugman@meertens.knaw.nl, Erika Kuijpers, h.m.e.p.kuijpers@vu.nl, Inger Leemans, i.b.leemans@vu.nl, Isa Maks, isa.maks@vu.nl

LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count; Pennebaker, Boyd, Jordan, \& Blackburn, 2015) is a tool  developed by social psychologists but increasingly being used in a DH context (e.g. Boyd, 2017; Leemans, Van der Zwaan, Maks, Kuijpers, \& Steenbergh, 2017; Piper, 2016). The tool counts words in texts from a number of psychologically meaningful categories. The outcome is, for each submitted text, the percentage of words in that text in each of the categories.

Categories include, among others, emotions, cognitions, senses, biology, function words, and ‘life concerns’. At the basis of LIWC is a dictionary that assigns words to categories. A Dutch version of the LIWC 2001 dictionary has been available since 2004 (Zijlstra, Van Meerveld, Van Middendorp, Pennebaker, \& Geenen, 2004). Recently, Dutch versions of the 2007 and 2015 dictionaries became available (Boot, Zijlstra, \& Geenen, 2017; Van Wissen \& Boot, 2017). There is also an experimental historicized version of the dictionary, for doing research into historic texts. In French, there exists a translation of the LIWC 2007 dictionary (Piolat, Booth, Chung, Davids, \& Pennebaker, 2011).

The aim of the workshop at DH Benelux 2018 is to bring together DH researchers from the Benelux countries who use or might use LIWC in their research. The content of the workshop will be decided based on the interest and knowledge level of the participants, but may include:

    Instruction in using LIWC (this will be a minor component, as the tool is largely self explanatory);
    Mini-presentations of DH projects that have been using LIWC (by workshop participants as well as organizers);
    A discussion of the differences between the dictionary versions (2007 was translated
    manually, 2015 was translated in an automated procedure);
    Discussion about how to evaluate the outcome of the tool and be sure that it is a reliable
    method to answer specific research questions (beyond its original field of application);
    Discussion of shortcomings of the dictionary (versions) and possible ways to address the
    Shortcomings;
    Discussion of possible extensions to the dictionary;
    Discussion of the copyright status of the dictionary in relation to an open source and open access scientific landscape;
    Discussion on the limitations of the historicized version of the dictionary and ways to
    address them;
    Discussion of software that can be used in conjunction with the LIWC dictionaries.

The hoped-for results of the workshop will be increased cooperation between LIWC users, an
increased understanding of LIWC possibilities in a humanities context and a shared agenda for
addressing limitations of the current dictionary translations.},

For example, people readily care about acts of terrorism and humanitarian crises because they appeal to our compassion for human suffering. These struggles also command attention where social interactions have the power to produce or intensify the emotional responses of those who participate in them.  From passionate protests to poignant speeches, Andrew A. G. Ross analyzes high-emotion events with an eye to how they shape public sentiment and finds that there is no single answer. The politically powerful play to the public’s emotions to advance their political aims, and such appeals to emotion also often serve to sustain existing values and institutions. But the affective dimension can produce profound change, particularly when a struggle in the present can be shown to line up with emotionally resonant events from the past. Extending his findings to well-studied conflicts, including the War on Terror and the violence in Rwanda and the Balkans, Ross identifies important sites of emotional impact missed by earlier research focused on identities and interests.},

This book takes a practical, hands-on approach to teaching you a reliable, cost-effective approach to mining the vast, untold riches buried within all forms of text using R. Author Ted Kwartler clearly describes all of the tools needed to perform text mining and shows you how to use them to identify practical business applications to get your creative text mining efforts started right away. With the help of numerous real-world examples and case studies from industries ranging from healthcare to entertainment to telecommunications, he demonstrates how to execute an array of text mining processes and functions, including sentiment scoring, topic modelling, predictive modelling, extracting clickbait from headlines, and more. You’ll learn how to:  Identify actionable social media posts to improve customer service Use text mining in HR to identify candidate perceptions of an organisation, match job descriptions with resumes, and more. Extract priceless information from virtually all digital and print sources, including the news media, social media sites, PDFs, and even JPEG and GIF image files Make text mining an integral component of marketing in order to identify brand evangelists, impact customer propensity modelling, and much more  Most companies’ data mining efforts focus almost exclusively on numerical and categorical data, while text remains a largely untapped resource. Especially in a global marketplace where being first to identify and respond to customer needs and expectations imparts an unbeatable competitive advantage, text represents a source of immense potential value. Unfortunately, there is no reliable, cost-effective technology for extracting analytical insights from the huge and ever-growing volume of text available online and other digital sources, as well as from paper documents—until now.},

Using our framework we perform two large-scale empirical studies to quantify the extent to which sentiment varies across time and between communities. We induce and release historical sentiment lexicons for 150 years of English and community-specific sentiment lexicons for 250 online communities from the social media forum Reddit. The historical lexicons show that more than 5\% of sentiment-bearing (non-neutral) English words completely switched polarity during the last 150 years, and the community-specific lexicons highlight how sentiment varies drastically between different communities.},

questions about emotions associated with terms, we show how the inclusion of a word choice question

level  (rather  than  at  word  level).  We  conducted  experiments  on  how  to  formulate  the  emotion-

Variation in frequencies of word usage of constructs relevant to terror management theory (e.g. death, worldview, self-esteem, relationships) are investigated over a time period of 209 years. Study 1 corroborated previous TMT findings and demonstrated that word use of constructs related to death and of constructs related to patriotism and romantic relationships significantly co-vary over time. Study 2 showed that the use of the word “death” most strongly co-varies over time with the use of medical constructs, but also co-varies with the use of constructs related to violence, relationships, religion, positive sentiment, and negative sentiment. Study 3 found that a change in the use of death related words is associated with an increase in the use of fear related words, but not in anxiety related words. Results indicate that the described methodology generates valuable insights regarding terror management theory and provide new perspectives for theoretical advances.},

We study a number of specific datasets and show, among other things, how collections of texts can be organized for affect-based search and how books portray different entities through co-occurring emotion words. Analysis of the Enron Email Corpus reveals that there are marked differences across genders in how they use emotion words in work-place email. Finally, we show that fairy tales have more extreme emotion densities than novels.},

Framed in terms of self-development, citizenship took on a broad meaning, not just in terms of political rights and obligations, but also in the context of material, social, psychological and moral conditions that individuals should meet in order to develop themselves and be able to act according to those rights and obligations in a responsible way. In the post-war period of reconstruction (1945–65), as well as between 1965 and 1985, the link between mental health and ideals of citizenship was coloured by the public memory of World War II and the German occupation, albeit in completely different, even opposite ways. The memory of the war, and especially the public consideration of its victims, changed drastically in the mid-1960s, and the mental health sector played a crucial role in bringing this change about. The widespread attention to the mental effects of the war that surfaced in the late 1960s after a period of 20 years of public silence should be seen against the backdrop of the combination of democratization and the emancipation of emotions.},

Yet, recent cultural trends run in the opposite direction. Using the Google Books corpus, coupled with two metadata-rich corpora of Anglophone fiction books, we show a decrease in emotionality in English-speaking literature starting plausibly in the nineteenth century. We show that this decrease cannot be explained by changes unrelated to emotionality (such as demographic dynamics concerning age or gender balance, changes in vocabulary richness, or changes in the prevalence of literary genres), and that, in our three corpora, the decrease is driven almost entirely by a decline in the proportion of positive emotion-related words, while the frequency of negative emotion-related words shows little if any decline. Consistently with previous studies, we also find a link between ageing and negative emotionality at the individual level.},

This article presents the Dutch translation of LIWC 2007. It describes the procedure of translation and it compares the dictionaries on a corpus of parallel (Dutch-English) texts. The Dutch and English dictionaries give similar results on a collection of translated texts in both languages, except for a small number of categories. Correlations are high to very high, effect sizes of the differences between word counts are low to medium. The LIWC 2007 categories can now be used to analyse Dutch language texts.},
